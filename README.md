# Parrot-A.R-Drone-Vulnerability-accessment-penetration-testing

# INTRODUCTION
# Due to the increasing use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and the widening scope of their potential uses, it is critical to look at the security issue. UAVs are employed in a number of operations, including warfare and surveillance. Sensitive information that can be a target for assaults is sent, gathered, or carried by UAVs. Communication between the user and the UAV must therefore be secured. Several drone vulnerabilities are presented in this article, which looks at drone security. Five primary attack types were discovered. Investigations are conducted into several types of attacks, including Denial of Service, deauthentication, Man-in-the-Middle, Unauthorized Root Access, and Packet Spoofing. Furthermore, the mechanism of each attack was explained, along with countermeasures.


# PARROT A.R DRONE 2.0
# For this project, a Parrot AR 2.0 drone was used. The Parrot AR drone is classified as a multirotor UAV, or a quadcopter UAV. Expanded polypropylene (EPP) is used for the drone's hull, or housing. The total weight is 420 g (indoors) or 380 g due to the motors being mounted on carbon fibre tubes (Outdoor). Usually, battery systems use lithium polymer accumulators with 1000 mAh at 11.1 V. Additionally, 1500 battery capacity is offered. Four brushless inrunner motors on the quadcopter rotate at a rate of 28,500 revolutions per minute (RPM). An 8 MIPS AVR CPU powers each motor controller. Figures 3 depict the Parrot AR Drone 2.0's outdoor, inside, and component overviews, respectively.


# TECHNICAL APPROACH
# All UAVs use wireless technology for communication and connection to control systems. Therefore, the communication channel is vulnerable to different malicious attacks as a result of the parrot AR Done open wireless network's vulnerability. We'll look at several UAV vulnerabilities and hacking methods that can be used to analyse UAV vulnerabilities.


# ATTACK PERFORMED 
# The Parrot AR drone 2.0 was attacked in this experiment using the open WiFi as the target. Manufacturers of parrots recently added the WPA/WPA2 range and speed. However, it is still vulnerable to WiFi attacks. A weak password can be readily cracked using tools like aircrack-ng (Elyas & Kumar, 2021). The Parrot AR 2.0 drone, however, is completely devoid of encryption. Images of the smartphone, Parrot AR drone, and wireless adapter used in this experiment are shown in Figure 8. The setup for the experiment is shown in the next image in figure 8.

# NETWORK MAPPING
# As soon as the battery is connected, the UAV immediately begins to operate. It will check the drone PAR2's electric motor and turn on an open Wi-Fi hotspot. After joining this Wi-Fi hotspot, the Nmap utility was used to scan the IP address of the drone for ports. The Nmap utility shows the ports that are currently being used by different services, including ports by drones. According to the Nmap scan of the drone's IP address, all ports found are open.

# OPEN WIFI
# The Parrot AR 2.0 drone has an IEEE WiFi radio and an IP address of 192.168.1.1. (802.11ac). Using an open, unencrypted Wi-Fi network, anyone may control the Parrot AR 2.0 drone by connecting to it. The problem is more significant because several users can control the drone without a mechanism to verify who is its rightful owner because Parrot AR 2.0 allows multiple clients to connect to the network. The difficulty with these networks is the enormous number of vulnerabilities connected with open WiFi. Although producers might believe they are providing a valuable service to their consumers, it's likely that the security on these networks is either poor or nonexistent. Drone unsecured WIFI can be vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks, sniffing and surveillance, unencrypted ports, malware dissemination, and other threats.


# The drone was subjected to a deauthentication assault utilising aircrack-ng. By intercepting the network packets of the drone without actually connecting to it, the attack aims to disconnect the authenticated owner of a Parrot AR drone. The wireless network is scanned using Airmon-ng by placing the network adapter in monitor mode. Airodump-ng is used to spy into the network and capture all packets originating from that network only after the Parrot AR drone has been located. Once the list of clients is provided, Aireplay-ng is used, which continuously sends de-authentication packets to the connected drone user and disconnects the client, allowing a de-authentication attack to be carried out. In the short time, the attacker can establish a connection and control the drone.
# The linked device continuously receives deauthentication packets from the hacker's computer, which has a MAC address of 84:38:38:?:?:? and a BSSID of A0:14:3D:?:?:? Repeatedly sending deauthentication packets can jam the entire communications network, making it impossible for any device to connect. 200 reauthentication packets are sent by Aireplay-ng, 100 to the client and 100 to the drone BSSID. DE Even though the deauthentication attack may not be very effective on its own, authenticating a UAV mid-flight can be dangerous. Additionally, it may act as a launchpad for more serious assaults, ultimately giving the assailant complete control over the drone transmission. 


# OPEN TELNET
# Once the Parrot AR 2.0 drone is linked to the network, the attacker can Telnet to it. The UAV's IP address is 192.168.1.1. Due to the fact that various users can connect to the Parrot AR drone's Wi-Fi, the act of simply attempting to join to the network quickly generates a large number of requests, which could cause a Denial of Service (DOS) and prevent the initial commands from being carried out. By telnetting to the machine, the attacker can access the entire file system as the root user. With TELNET control information injected at regular intervals, a telnet connection transfers data via the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).


# OPEN FTP PORT
# Hackers can sign into the FTP without any encryption by connecting to the drone's WiFi and stealing private information like media and flight data. The FTP directory, where photos, videos, and other valuable files like scripts that prevent the drone from flying into a no-fly zone are stored, is accessible via FTP access according to the default settings. Data sharing from a server to a client is commonly done via the File Transfer Protocol (FTP). Between the client and the server, there are many control and data links. FTP is also vulnerable to spoofing attacks, in which a hacker assumes the identity of a reliable user or device on the network. A common spoofing tactic is a man-in-the-middle attack. The drone already has an open WIFI, which would let an attacker to utilise brute force to intercept drone data while appearing to be a valid client.


# MODIFYING FILE SYSTEM
# A read-only file belonging to the root can be altered by an unauthorised user due to a bug in the Linux kernel (Busybox). Both FTP and telnet allow for the modification of files without the need for authentication. The majority of the files, with the exception of the /data directory, which is the FTP media directory, are read-only now that the Parrot AR Drone 3.0 has been released. The hacker can get around read-only data by remounting the entire system files, despite the fact that this is the default setting. For this exploit, a file called "test.exe was uploaded to the drone, in a real-world scenario. This attack might result in malware payload injection, whereby an attacker could inject malware into the drone and perhaps gain control of it.


# UNAUTHORISED ROOT ACCESS
# An attacker with full root control and unrestricted access to the ports can access the AR Drone scripts and files. For this attack, FTP and Telnet were used as two different protocols. By using Telnet to access the operating system filesystem, the UAV has been turned off. User identifiers, encryption keys, and numerous UAV file systems were used to identify the data. By executing the specified scripts, the UAV can be compromised. Data transmission from the UAV to the intruder and root filesystem access are made possible by FTP. This attack could also be viewed as a bid to reveal sensitive data or alter information, given that the attacker obtained sensitive data from the authorised user in order to take control of the UAV and communicate it to them. 


# ACCESSING UAV CAMERA
# The Parrot AR drone uses FPV “First Person View” which was easily accessible after connecting to the drone using FFplay. FFplay is built based on the SDL framework, it is a media play that can be used to stream video feed through an IP address (Yun, et al., 2012). Using the drone's IP address and FTP port (196.168.1.1:5555) it was easy to capture a live video stream from the drone.
